# Introduction

## Catastrophe modeling
Overview of a Catastrophe Model

A typical cat modelling approach follows four important steps, which are 1. Quantification of hazard, 2. Exposure database, 3. Vulnerability of the portfolio buildings and 4. Financial loss based on repair cost and downtime.

Hazard module helps to quantify the intensity of the peril at any location under study.

Exposure database system maintains attributes of portfolio buildings which are targets of peril.

Vulnerability module provides probabilistic loss ratios for the building using the intensity of peril at the specific location.

Loss module converts the loss ratios and incorporates policy specification for different properties to determine actual dollar loss.
